Implementation of parameterized neural network (PNN) by using Keras.

It runs on 114.212.235.193 since Bowen Zhang ( one of members of NJU HEP group ) has installed Keras and its depencence on it(Thanks, Bowen!).

```bash
ssh -Y UserName@114.212.235.193
```
+ Note: this machine is in 526, Physics Building, NJU.


Then, you can create an empty folder for your work.
